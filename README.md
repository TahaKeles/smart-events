ðŸš€ Getting Started

Prerequisites
â€¢ Node.js (version 14+)
â€¢ npm or Yarn
â€¢ A MongoDB database connection (e.g., MongoDB Atlas free cluster)

Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/TahaKeles/smart-events.git
   cd smart-events

2. Backend Setup
   cd backend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your MongoDB connection string

3. Backend Environment Variables

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

4. Start the backend server

cd backend
npm run dev

Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env

2. Start the frontend server

cd ../frontend
npm start

Environment Variables

# Edit .env with your API URL

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key

3. Run the application

# Start backend server

cd backend
npm start

4. Testing

a. Unit/Integration Tests: Write tests using frameworks like Jest or Mocha + Chai for your backend.
b. Manual Testing: Use Postman or cURL to send requests to:
â€¢ POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
â€¢ POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
â€¢ GET http://localhost:5000/api/events
â€¢ etc.
c. Frontend: Validate forms, login flows, and event discovery in the browser.

5. Enhancements

- Geospatial Queries: Use MongoDBâ€™s $near or $geoWithin to filter events by user location.
- Advanced Recommendation: Implement a scoring algorithm that factors in userâ€™s interest match, event popularity, or distance weighting.
- Pagination: Add pagination for large event lists.
- Security: Use HTTPS, secure cookies, and improve JWT handling (refresh tokens, short expiration, etc.).
